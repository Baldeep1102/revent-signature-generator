Context - objective here is to build a signature generator which will be deployed in cloud for our company, Revent to be used by employees of the company to create a signature.. there should be a tiny admin panel for the same where we can upload the logo, and if there are any awards/seals that the company has won which it would like to flaunt from time to time (to be used if uploaded) and if some context is given etc. 

Main idea is that it has to be responsive for mobile and desktop, generates signatures that are great to look at (almost wow) [professional, modern and classy]
